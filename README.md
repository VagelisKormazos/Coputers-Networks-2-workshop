Workshop with Cisco Tracer in Computers Networks
##
Topic:OSPF algorithm , Access List, Nat
##
Issues:
1) Implement the topology with the software provided. In cases where no IP is given, use the software with the software you have provided.addresses are not given, they must be calculated by you and assigned to the corresponding interfaces of the routers. Note that the IP addresses provided correspond to the IPs of the
networks in the topology - excluding the IP address of the eth1 of the Bono router.
2) The routers will utilize the OSPF algorithm. To the Internet use static routing.
3) All stations in the topology must have access to the HTTP service that served by a server on the Internet. They do not have access to any other Internet service.
4) The networks located on the Hermes router are accessible to all other stations in the topology only if the ping and traceroute tools are used.
5) In Bono it is necessary to implement the overloaded NAT (PAT) technique with overloaded public IP 143.233.173.2/30.
